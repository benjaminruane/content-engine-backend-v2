WRITING GUIDELINES – PARTNERS GROUP

1. Language & Formatting

- Use US English throughout.
- Use currency abbreviations (USD, EUR, CHF, GBP) instead of currency symbols.
- Express all percentages using the % symbol (e.g., 44%).
- Spell out whole numbers from one through eleven; use numerals for 12 and above. Maintain consistency within a list or related set of figures.
- Use apostrophe-style thousand separators (e.g., 1'000, not 1,000).
- Use regular hyphens (-); do not use en or em dashes.
- Use "US" and "UK" (no periods).
- Omit company legal suffixes (e.g., Ltd, Inc, Corp, Holdings) unless essential for clarity.
- Spell out "year on year" unless used adjectivally ("year-on-year growth").
- Always spell out quarters (e.g., "first quarter of 2025"); do not write Q1, Q2, etc.
- Prefer "prior year" and "prior quarter" when making comparisons.
- Round all figures to one decimal place unless the source provides whole numbers only.
- Avoid referencing events more than 12 months old unless explicitly relevant.
- Always spell out "Partners Group"; do not abbreviate to "PG".


2. Content & Substance

- Commentary must be concise, fact-based, and specific.
- Avoid interpretive, speculative, promotional, or overly evaluative language.
- Provide qualitative drivers alongside quantitative information where relevant.
- Include historical context where appropriate (prior year, prior quarter, multi-year trends).
- Avoid jargon and technical accounting terminology. Use clear, plain language.
- Exclude or approximate specific financial details such as revenue, EBITDA, valuation multiples, net debt, or growth rates unless they are publicly available in the source material.
- When describing an original investment, include the investment rationale or background if available.
- Avoid references to fund economics (fees, GP commitment, carry, hurdle rate, etc.).


3. Narrative Flow & Readability

- Use a professional, client-facing tone.
- Write as a cohesive narrative, not a list of disconnected sentences.
- Use transitions and linking phrases to maintain flow, for example:
  - "This improvement was driven by..."
  - "In contrast..."
  - "Meanwhile..."
- Vary sentence structure to avoid repetitive patterns, especially when introducing figures or listing sectors.
- Maintain a logical progression, typically moving from macro context to thematic points and then to specific examples or company-level details.
- Remove redundant modifiers unless they materially enhance clarity.
- Moderate subjective descriptors (e.g., "strong", "significant", "successful") unless they appear in the source material or are directly supported by evidence.


4. Forbidden Terms & Preferred Alternatives

Avoid the following terms unless quoting directly or required for factual accuracy:

- "deal": use "transaction", "acquisition", or "investment".
- "M&A": use "acquisitions" or "transactions".
