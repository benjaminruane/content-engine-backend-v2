const SCENARIO_INSTRUCTIONS = {
  new_investment: `
Treat this as a new direct investment transaction.
- Focus on describing the company, what it does, and key operational highlights.
- Explain the investment thesis and why Partners Group was attracted to the opportunity.
- Mention whether it is a lead, joint, or co-investment if that information is available.
- Avoid discussing exits or portfolio performance; stay focused on the entry transaction context.
  `,
    new_fund_commitment: `
Treat this as a new commitment by Partners Group to a private markets fund or program.

COMPLETE VERSION (internal / investor commentary):
- Aim for around 150 words, in two paragraphs:
  - Paragraph 1: describe the fund
  - Paragraph 2: explain the investment merits and why Partners Group was attracted to it.
- Start with a formulation similar to:
  "In TRANSACTION DATE, Partners Group committed to INVESTMENT, a ..."
- Where the information is available in the source material, include:
  - A clear description of the fund and its target size.
  - The fund's investment strategy and whether this is a new strategy or a continuation of an existing strategy.
  - How many underlying investments the fund plans to make.
  - Key sectors the fund targets.
  - Typical target equity or enterprise value range for each deal.
  - The manager's value creation approach, described both thematically and structurally
    (for example: "digital transformation" and "Portfolio Support Group").
  - The main investment merits, grouped into themes such as track record, entry valuation and operating team.
  - Why Partners Group was attracted to the commitment, using a narrative tone that remains factual and neutral.
  - If the fund has already started investing or has seed assets, briefly mention these
    (e.g. asset name and one-line description) only where supported by the sources.
- Do not introduce fund terms such as fee levels, carry rates, hurdle rates or GP commitments unless they are clearly
  and publicly disclosed.
- Do not invent numerical details (target size, number of investments, valuation ranges, etc.) that are not supported
  by the source material.

GENERAL:
- Keep tone factual, concise and professional.
- Follow the STYLE GUIDE strictly for language, number formatting and terminology.
`,

  exit_realisation: `
Treat this as a realisation or exit of an existing investment.
- Describe what happened in the transaction (e.g., full exit, partial sale, recapitalisation).
- Provide concise context on the asset and holding period if available.
- Focus on drivers of value creation that are explicitly supported by the source material.
- Avoid disclosing sensitive or non-public valuation or return metrics.
  `,
  revaluation: `
Treat this as a valuation update for an existing investment.
- Describe the asset briefly and the key drivers of the valuation movement (if given).
- Focus on operational or market factors mentioned in the source material.
- Avoid speculating about performance or outlook beyond the evidence provided.
  `,

    fund_distribution: `
Treat this as a distribution or exit event at fund level, where a fund returns proceeds to investors.

COMPLETE VERSION (internal / investor commentary):
- Aim for around 140 words in a single paragraph.
- Focus on the largest component of the distribution, while acknowledging there may be multiple sources.
- Use a formulation similar to:
  "In TRANSACTION DATE, INVESTMENT distributed proceeds from ..."
- Where supported by the sources, include:
  - The source of the distribution: what was realised or sold, when it occurred and how
    (for example, full exit, partial sale, recapitalisation or refinancing).
  - A concise description of the asset or assets sold or realised (or partially realised).
  - Returns on the investment, if known and clearly supported by the source documents
    (for example, high-level multiple or performance indicators), keeping in mind sensitivity.
  - Key transformation or value-creation actions implemented since the original investment
    (for example, operational improvements, add-on acquisitions, strategic repositioning), only where explicitly supported.
- If there are multiple sources of distribution, focus on the largest and qualify this with
  wording such as "among others" to signal that there were additional smaller contributors.
- Avoid disclosing sensitive or non-public valuation or return metrics; keep performance commentary high-level and
  consistent with the STYLE GUIDE and source materials.

GENERAL:
- Keep tone factual, concise and neutral.
- Follow the STYLE GUIDE strictly, including number formatting and avoidance of speculative language.
`,

    fund_capital_call: `
Treat this as a capital call by a fund, focusing on the main use of proceeds.

COMPLETE VERSION (internal / investor commentary):
- Aim for around 140 words in a single paragraph.
- Focus on the largest use of funds that gave rise to the capital call, while acknowledging there may be other uses.
- Use a formulation similar to:
  "In TRANSACTION DATE, INVESTMENT called capital for ..."
- Where supported by the sources, include:
  - The primary purpose of the capital call (for example, funding a new investment, follow-on capital,
    fees and expenses or other specific uses).
  - A concise description of the asset acquired or financed and the transaction (what was acquired, when and how).
  - Any headline valuation metric for the underlying transaction (for example, enterprise value)
    only if explicitly provided in the source material.
  - A clear investment thesis: why this use of capital is attractive or strategic for the fund.
  - A brief value-creation plan (for example, operational improvements, organic growth, M&A),
    described thematically and only where supported by the sources.
  - Any latest developments or early results that are clearly value-adding and safe to mention.
- If there are multiple uses of the called capital, describe the largest explicitly and qualify this with
  wording such as "among others" to signal that other uses exist.
- Avoid disclosing sensitive or non-public financial terms beyond what is clearly stated in the sources.

GENERAL:
- Keep tone factual, concise and professional.
- Follow the STYLE GUIDE strictly, including number handling and terminology.
`,

  
  default: `
Write clear, concise, fact-based commentary aligned with the given scenario.
- Follow the STYLE GUIDE exactly.
- Keep the tone neutral and professional.
- Do not invent facts or rationales that are not supported by the source material.
